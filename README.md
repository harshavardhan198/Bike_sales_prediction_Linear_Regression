# Bike_sales_prediction_Linear_Regression
Rental Bike Prediction using different techniques of Linear Regression.

The feature selection ,i.e, selecting subset of input variables that are most relevant to the target variable, was done by RFE(Recursive Feature Elimination) method.

The value of R2 for the model, is 0.83. It indicates that the regression model is an adequate fit to our data.

Also for a good model, the errors between the Trainset RMSE and Testset RMSE must be similar. 
With Linear Regression (using Stochastic Gradient Descent), the difference between the Train RMSE and Test RMSE was reduced to 0.004.
